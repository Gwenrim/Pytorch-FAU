# Pytorch-FAU

The Pytorch implementation of **Facial Action Unit Intensity Estimation**. 

## Environment

- Ubuntu 18.04.4
- Python 3.7
- PyTorch 1.3.0
- Torchvision
- Python-OpenCV

***Datasets***

For data preparation, please make a request for the [BP4D database](http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~lijun/Research/3DFE/3DFE_Analysis.html) and the [DISFA database](http://mohammadmahoor.com/disfa/). 

***Usage***

The pre-trained model can be obtained from the [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15cJtFEkrOrbt5FfZOxnWulQhaOKfaLtN/view?usp=sharing). Please download it under your own path. You can change default path by modifying `--model_path`.

- `run_demo.py`: visualizes the predicted AU heatmaps and intensities for the example images (`data/*.jpg`).

```python 
cd Pytorch-FAU/
python run_demo.py
```

The full code will be available soon.
